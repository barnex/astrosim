# astrosim

Asteroid simulation in a 2D solar system.

E.g.: below are a few thousand asteroids moving in the gravity of the Sun (center) and Jupiter (bright dot). Asteroids in orbital resonance with Jupiter eventually get kicked away and leave empty bands. (Time is gradually speeding up for clarity.)
